# Project goPolyglottal
This project was made during a one-week sprint at [Code Chrysalis Tokyo](www.codechrysalis.io).
The aim is to dabble into one language during one week and learn similarities and differences with Javascript (the main language taught at Code Chrysalis)

# Summary 🧑‍💼
This app uses **Go** to create a simple REST API server. The front-end pages are served using Go's template engine.
The database contains information regarding companies potentially recruiting in Tokyo. (This API was the first step towards 
creating a tool enabling users to record useful data regarding their job hunt).
